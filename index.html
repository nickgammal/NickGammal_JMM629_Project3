      What is a Wandering Albatross?

      <h3>What are they like?</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! This is a wandering albatross. They are large seabirds that 
        spend the majority of their life "wandering" about the Southern 
        Ocean. Albatrosses are the group of birds with the largest 
        wingspan in the world. Enter your height in centimeters to the 
        figure below to see how tall you are compared to their wingspan. 
        Despite their great size, these birds typically only weigh about 25 
        kilograms, surprisingly light for such a large animal!

      <h3>Where do they live?</h3>
      <p>
        Wandering albatrosses spend most of their time flying or floating on 
        the ocean. They spend very little time on land, and when they do it 
        is only in coastal or island regions of the antarctic and 
        subantarctic. Notice the lack of data in the South Pacific Ocean. 
        This reflects the observation bias due to increased scientific effort 
        in waters near Australia and near scientific stations on the 
        Antarctic Peninsula.

      <h3>How often do they land?</h3>
      <p>
        Wandering albatrosses can fly for about 16,000 kilometers without 
        resting on land or on water. They only spend time regularly on land 
        every two years during breeding season (which lasts from the end of 
        November to the beginning of March). These two maps show the 
        locations of albatrosses seen during breeding season (Blue) and 
        outside of breeding season (Yellow). Notice that a large proportion 
        of the birds seen during mating season were seen over open ocean. 
        That is beacuse only about half the birds will breed each season 
        while the other half is "on sabbatical". This phenomenon is called 
        "temporal reproductive isolation," which can lead to the two 
        breeding groups evolving into separate species over generational 
        timescales.
